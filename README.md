A Comprehensive Repository for Learning and Practice
This repository serves as a valuable resource for enhancing your skills in various areas of software development and testing. It comprises two distinct folders, each dedicated to a specific domain:

Exercises and Explorations: This folder houses a collection of exercises and practical examples designed to solidify your understanding of Cypress and Pactum.js. 
These powerful tools facilitate efficient end-to-end testing and API testing, respectively.
Weather Application: In this folder, you'll find a simple yet functional weather application built using an external API.
This project not only showcases your ability to integrate third-party services but also demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development and test automation. 
Leveraging the power of Cypress, you've created a suite of automated tests to ensure the application's reliability and consistent user experience across various browsers and devices.
